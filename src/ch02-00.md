# Parsing & Printing

## Introduction

Scheme, having an incredibly simple grammar, lends itself well to a hand-written lexer and parser.

Marwood's parser is composed of three separate components:

* the `Cell` object, which represents a [sexpr] (or Scheme's AST) in Rust

* the `lexer` (or scanner or tokenizer), which is responsible for turning plain-text scheme into a list of tokens to be consumed by Marwood's `parser`.

* the `parser`, which is responsible for constructing an aggregate structure called `Cell` from the lexer output
