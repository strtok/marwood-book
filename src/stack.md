# Stack

Marwood's stack is represented by an upward growing stack of VCell values, and a stack pointer `%sp` that represents the current top of the stack.

The stack's main purpose is to support the application of procedures, which include arguments and meta data required for call frame setup.

Here's an example stack during evaluation of the expression `(+ 10 5)`, with the stack pointer pointing at slot 7, and the arguments to `+` having been pushed in slots 5 and 6.

| Slot     | Value                   | SP |
|----------|-------------------------|----|
| **7**    | **%argc[2]**            | ‚Üê  |
| **6**    | **Fixnum(5)**           |    |
| **5**    | **Fixnum(10)**          |    |
| 4        | %bp[$00]                |    |
| 3        | %ip[$223][$06]          |    |
| 2        | %ep[$ffffffffffffffff]  |    |
| 1        | %argc[0]                |    |
| 0        | Undefined               |    |


# Stack Structure

Marwood's stack is implemented with a Vec<VCell>, and stack pointer `sp` containing the slot number of the current top of stack. 

```rust,noplayground
pub struct Stack {
    /// Stack contents
    stack: Vec<VCell>,

    /// Stack Pointer. SP points to the top value to be pushed onto the stack,
    /// This value backs the SP register of the VM
    sp: usize,
}
```

>#### Stack Growth
>The `push` operation is backed directly by Vec's push function, which will grow the underlying vector automatically. The stack does not currently have any method of shrinking the stack vector.
